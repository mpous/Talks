## Abstract

Deploying IoT devices in bulk, and then managing and maintaining that fleet of devices is hard work! At Balena, our customers do that everyday, and when they run into trouble, we do our best to help and support them. As a result, we’ve seen firsthand (many times over now!) how projects can succeed, or fail. In this talk, we’ll capture some of the best practices and lessons we’ve learned over the years, helping customers deploy and maintain fleets of hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of Edge and IoT devices. Specifically, we’ll discuss and explain some FleetOps strategies we’ve seen be successful, we’ll cover some basic connectivity choices and best practices for IoT devices, talk about storage media and SD Card corruption, and finish up with a quick discussion of hardware selection (which can be quite challenging with the current Chip Shortage and Supply Chain issues) based on anticipated workload and environmental constraints such as power, size, and thermal considerations. We'll be sure to leave plenty of time for questions and discussion, because attendees will likely have some stories of their own to share.
