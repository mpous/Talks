# Location and Date

Barcelona, 27th November 2021

# Presentation Title

Build a Machine Learning IoT Device running Python

# Strategic Messaging

The goal of the workshop is to showcase to the Barcelona Python community how to create a fleet of edge AI devices using Python, Edge Impulse and balena.

During the workshop attendants will learn how to create a Bird Watcher using a Raspberry Pi and a USB camera (or Pi Camera). Using Python we will get the feed from the camera, apply machine learning models from Edge Impulse and send telegram messages. Finally we will be able to deploy a fleet of Bird Watchers in a simple way all around the world.

The goal of this session is to introduce IoT and AI topics to Python developers. Topics such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and citizen science are consistently united in a single project.
