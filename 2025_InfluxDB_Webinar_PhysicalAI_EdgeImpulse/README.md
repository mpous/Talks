## Abstract

Industrial IoT is rapidly evolving, and with it comes the need to make real-time sense of data where it’s generated. Enter Physical AI: the convergence of machine learning and time series analytics at the edge. In this webinar, Edge Impulse and InfluxData join forces to demonstrate how engineers can apply AI-driven insights to sensor data, enabling smarter operations, predictive maintenance, and optimized performance across industrial environments.

You’ll hear how Edge Impulse’s platform accelerates AI development on the edge, and how InfluxDB 3’s Processing Engine brings powerful time series machine learning into the mix—together enabling the next generation of industrial intelligence.

In this webinar, you’ll learn:

* How Physical AI is reshaping Industrial IoT and enabling smarter edge decision-making.
* The role of Edge Impulse in simplifying the development and deployment of machine learning models on sensor data.
* How InfluxDB 3’s Processing Engine enhances time series analysis for predictive and real-time use cases.
* Practical examples of applying time series machine learning and Physical AI for industrial efficiency and innovation.
