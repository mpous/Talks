## Abstract

Existing technologies enable developers to send data over a long distance with a tiny amount of energy. These communication technologies belong to the Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN), and they are amazing.

LoRaWAN (LoRa Wide Area Network) is an example of LPWAN. Using LoRa (Long Range) radio-frequencies, you can send tiny packages of data over long distances (5-6 miles away depending on the topology) with simple battery-powered devices. The radio packets are captured by gateways which relay over the Internet the LoRa packages to network servers.

Most developers aren't aware of such technologies or about how to create this type of networking for the community. In this workshop we would like to show how easy it is to build a LoRaWAN gateway with a Raspberry Pi and a LoRa concentrator running on balena.

The goal of this workshop is twofold, first to educate developers on this simple and amazing LPWAN technology and then to highlight the partnership among Seeed and balena, which manages +100K LoRaWAN gateways all around the world successfully running on Raspberry Pi 4.

To follow along on your own hardware, the ideal configuration would be as follows:

- A Raspberry Pi 4 (Raspberry Pi 3 works great as well).
- A LoRa concentrator (e.g. Seeed WM1302 or similar SX1301/1302/1303 might work compatible with your region).
- For the LoRa node, the workshop leader is going to use a SenseCAP S2101 and S2104. However feel free to bring a devkit such as Seeed E5 Development Kit or any other LoRa node you have at home. 
- SD card and power supplies.

## Strategic Messaging

* LPWAN networks exist with awesome communication technologies such as LoRaWAN.
* LoRaWAN need gateways to create coverage. Feel free to use fleet management tools such as balena to reduce friction.
* You also can get the advantage of using containers and create your standalone LoRaWAN server solution along with packet forwarder and MING (MQTT, InfluxDB, NodeRED and Grafana) in a Raspberry Pi with a LoRa concentrator (e.g. Seeed WM1302).
