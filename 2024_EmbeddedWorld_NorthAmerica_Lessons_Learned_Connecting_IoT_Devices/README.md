# Lessons Learned Managing Nearly 1,000,000 IoT Devices

## Conference

Embedded World North America - IoT Session 

## Location and Date

Austin, TX - 8th October 2024

## Abstract

Are you a software engineer building IoT applications for IoT / edge devices in production?
Are you monitoring and managing large fleets of edge devices deployed all around the world?

Managing large fleets of IoT devices is complex due to the very nature of these devices: different types, different OS configurations and different everything!

Whether your fleet has one device or one million, you need the tools to develop, deploy and manage your IoT project. From my 15 years of experience, I have seen firsthand how projects can fail and succeed.

In this talk, Marc will capture some of the best practices and lessons we have learned over the years, helping customers deploy and maintain fleets of hundreds, thousands and tens of thousands of IoT and edge devices deployed all around the world.

Find here the lessons learned helping companies managing nearly 1 Million of Edge IoT devices or how this 30 minutes can save you 30 hours.
