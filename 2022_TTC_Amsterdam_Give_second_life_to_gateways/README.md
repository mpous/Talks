# Give a second life to any miner and create your own LoRaWAN network 

## Conference

The Things Network Conference 2022 - Amsterdam [link](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/conference/ttc-events/building-your-own-private-lorawan-network-server-and-gateway/)

## Location and Date

Amsterdam, Netherlands. 23rd September 2022

## Abstract

Marc Pous shows you how to convert an old miner or any gateway in to an open source LoRaWAN gateway, and start building your own network with The Things Stack.

## Strategic Messaging

* Fleet management tools are key to manage fleets of devices deployed anywhere
* Most of the LoRaWAN gateways don't use fleet management tools, so owners can't deploy new software, can't update new OS, can't access to diagnostics tools or ssh the device.
* Fleet owners might start using 21st century software tools such as containers, CI/CD, open source and more.
