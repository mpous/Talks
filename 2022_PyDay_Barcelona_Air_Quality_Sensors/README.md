# Build Air Quality Sensors with Python and choose your own adventure

## Conference

Python Barcelona Day 2022 [link](https://pybcn.org/events/pyday_bcn/pyday_bcn_2022/)

## Location and Date

Barcelona. 26th November 2022

## Abstract

The goal of this hands-on workshop is to build an Air Quality sensor (with Raspberry Pis) using Python to get the data from the sensors. 

From here you are going to choose what happens next. Would you like to store the data on a database? Visualize it? Send it to a Cloud? or to a Telegram bot? 

You choose your own adventure! Everything in the edge using containers, python and balena.

## Strategic Messaging

* Introduce to the Python developers the Internet of Things (IoT).
* Show how to decouple code and use containers on IoT devices.
