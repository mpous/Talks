# MQTT Standards for Integrating Edge AI Systems

## Conference

HiveMQ February 2024 Webinar [27 Feb 2024](https://www.hivemq.com/webinars/mqtt-standards-for-integrating-edge-ai-systems/)

## Location and Date

Online 27th February 2024

## Abstract

As industrial companies adopt MQTT as a key part of their digital transformation strategy, many are looking to shift AI data processing closer to production systems on the factory-floor — known as Edge AI. Yet, until now there has been no clear standard for integrating AI-generated predictions and insights from data sources into MQTT-backed environments.

In this webinar, we’ll present standards for the reliable and adaptable integration of Edge AI with MQTT frameworks, including the Flat MQTT and Sparkplug B specification. Gain valuable insights into optimizing your Edge AI deployments with MQTT standards.

Join Kudzai Manditereza and Magnus McCune of HiveMQ, along with Marc Pous of Balena for this forward-looking webinar.

- Learn why the MQTT standard for Edge AI was developed, the common patterns, and how they work
- View a live demonstration of the “unstructured data” and “fully integrated” patterns for Edge AI data integration with MQTT

## Strategic Messaging


* What is balena and how multiple balena devices from different fleets work together following the fully integrated pattern for Edge AI data integration with MQTT
* How balena publish and subscribe Edge AI data such as images through MQTT.
* Deep dive into the balena IIoT architectures with Seeed Studio reComputer J4012 NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX 16GB as Edge AI device running inferenca vision AI models in real-time.
