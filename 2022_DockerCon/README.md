# The Journey from Docker Desktop to +100K Devices running on Containers

## Abstract

In this talk, we’ll take the audience on a journey from building a container locally with Docker Desktop, take that container and build it for a Raspberry Pi, and then finally demonstrate how to turn this work into a real IoT project and scale it to an entire fleet of IoT devices.

Balena has had a long history of enabling IoT developers to build Docker containers for their fleets of edge devices. In this talk, you’ll learn what it takes to get started with an IoT project and scale up from Docker Desktop, to a few devices, to thousands of devices. We’ll explore a simple example Dockerfile running on your laptop, migrate that container to a Raspberry Pi on your desk, and then replicate that container infinitely using balenaCloud for easy orchestration.

Because containers aren’t typically built perfect the first time, nor do applications remain static or perpetual, we’ll also cover rapid iteration and experimentation using Local Mode for live deployments on that Raspberry Pi for testing purposes. Once we’re satisfied with the results, we can then trigger an update for the entire fleet to replicate the container that we have built on the Pi. These techniques can also feed a CI/CD pipeline, or other deployment strategy.

Developers who have a Raspberry Pi on their desk can follow along and perform the steps at home, or can simply watch and learn, then leverage these techniques for their next IoT project.
