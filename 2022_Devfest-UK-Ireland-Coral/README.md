# Learn how to use Google Coral for your Edge ML projects with balena.io

## Abstract

Google Coral provides a complete platform for accelerating neural networks on embedded devices. Coral helps you bring on-device AI application ideas from prototype to production.

Can we use AI to help us identify and quantify noise pollution? Spoiler alert! Sure we can :)

To help reduce noise pollution in our society, we need first to know which noises are most prevalent and how often they occur around us. However, how could we do this 24x7? Google Coral is here to help us to identify more than 10 different noises based on the Urban Sound Dataset.
 
Learn on this Workshop how to create a fleet of Edge Machine Learning devices using Google Coral technology and a microphone to identify and quantify the noise pollution around us.

Bring your own Coral board or Raspberry Pi with Coral USB accelerator and letâ€™s deploy a fleet together with balena.io
