# Building your own private LoRaWAN network server and gateway with Balena in 1 click

## Conference

The Things Network Conference 2022 - Amsterdam [link](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/conference/ttc-events/building-your-own-private-lorawan-network-server-and-gateway/)

## Location and Date

Amsterdam, Netherlands. 23rd September 2022

## Abstract

Learn how to build a standalone LoRaWAN server solution that runs on a Raspberry Pi with The Things Stack Open Source Edition on balena. Running it using containers on balena means that it can run alongside with other services such as packet forwarder, nodeRED, grafana, and more.

In this workshop we would like to add the LoRaWAN BasicsTM Station gateway service along with The Things Stack Community Edition. As a result, you can have all the LoRaWAN stack (gateway + network server) running together on a single Raspberry Pi using balena. Furthermore we are going to show you how to build a private LoRaWAN network on a professional gateway such as the new RAK7391 with balena.

Join the workshop to learn how to create your own private LoRaWAN solution, the easy way. And bring your own device (Raspberry Pi and laptop) to do it live with us.


## Strategic Messaging

* You can create your standalone LoRaWAN server solution along with packet forwarder and MING (MQTT, InfluxDB, NodeRED and Grafana) in a simple way with a single board computer and a LoRa concentrator (e.g. RAK2287).
